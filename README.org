Wanda (the fish)

* History

Scythed from https://github.com/sandys/wanda-the-fish by
https://extensions.gnome.org/accounts/profile/sandys1
which already reaped it from https://code.google.com/p/wandathefish/
by https://extensions.gnome.org/accounts/profile/k_labrie

This extension seems to want to replace its Gnome Applets alter ego.

** Changes

   - Cleaner code
   - New icon (looks more integrated)
   - New style (looks like a console)
   - Removed string not related to the fortune itself
   - Removed unnecessary ending newline
   - Handle unicode properly
   - Better handling of error messages (report what the system says)
